                There is this template of a "good Pakistani girl" or a "good desi girl" that a lot of women are expected to follow and it includes having your family be your first priority and your own ambitions and desires be the last. The strange thing is that even if you aren't doing anything "bad" you can still not be considered a good pakistani girl. For instance if a girl expressed that she wants to live in a completely different place from her family and a lot of people would question her almost as if its wrong. For a lot of pakistani people they have this set way of how you should live your life and any deviations from that are seen as a form of rebellion. Often women are seen as children that need to be guided in terms of what they can and can't do with their lives but also to act like an adult by being a wife in training. This dichotomy is troubling because it's basically saying you have the responsibility to act like a grow woman but you are expected to be obedient like a child who doesn't know any better.
                I have friends who have tried to have conversations with their parents about what they are thinking and its been ineffective because people are simply not willing to listen to Pakistani women on how she wants to live her life. Especially an unmarried Pakistani woman because in many older people's eyes they dont have any merit to have a voice or make their own decisions.

From being stared down with disgusting, frustrated eyes, no matter how covered you are, to being touched inappropriately if you walked down a crowded street or even when you went to your tailor for a fitting had become part of the norm. As a women you are always told to cover up, look down, stay quiet and stay alert, creating a fear within you as you grew up to expect the rule and will of men to run wild. I observed how women always ran amuck making sure their men were served and comfortable. You knew without even being told that men had the upper hand. Being raised in a household where my dad wanted me to have a voice as a woman, the contrast was very stark when I stepped outside my house. Even though I was given a very good education, I sensed a bias when compared to my brother as it was imperative for him to get the best as he was expected to run a household and be in charge, while I was expected to get educated, marry well and have kids. While my brother was sent abroad to study, I had to choose something within a driving distance so that I can be dropped and picked up. Why? Because what would my uncles think? What would the society think?

This causes a lot of people myself included to pick one or the other or to someone feel guilty for picking my own desires over something that is (sometimes unfairly) expected of me.

                The guise of marriage as the only stepping stone to having your own life for girls and women is so troubling. I have heard the phrase "you can do that when you get married" far too often and it is always women that are told that. as if women are too wild and must be tamed or some sort of control must be over them at all times.

I had a cousin who used to get beat up by her husband but she refused to tell anyone because she wanted to keep the appearance of a perfect family. That is because we were never told or taught to stand up for ourselves and to know what our limits for adjusting and sacrificing are. It is a woman's job to support her husband's dreams and aspirations and to ignore her own. Most women are thought to have no opinion and so aren't even included in what they call discussions for the men to take care of.

I was able to reconnect with some old friends and most of them in their early twenties are married and their occupation is a housewife. Obviously there is nothing wrong with this but I think if this is the path that is set up for you and its the only path than Its hardly a choice. I also have a cousin who is getting married and moving to Pakistan from the US and her in laws dont want her to work unless its a feminine career like a teacher. Similarly when I lived in pakistan my mom was a housewife with no source of income except my dad. Again there is nothing wrong with these situations but its important to come to terms with the fact that having total financial control over someone is so powerful and women are told thats not their job to worry about money but there is freedom in being able to support yourself and make your own decisions.

                I think it's more or less same all over the world, but it's more prevalent in Pakistan. People shield their cultural values with the name of religion. However, women should have been respected and cared for more if it were a true Muslim state. All the reasons come under one major area, the lack of education which is the root cause of all the ailment. To address these issues, the only answer is to increase literacy rate for both men and women.
                I have witnessed not only men harrassing women but our women causing these issues for other women.

                A lot of pressure from elders and men. Keeping women in the house, not letting them work. Their jobs include not only taking care of kids but also work, and home chores. Unfortunately in Pakistan, less support makes it harder for women to achieve all of this.

                I can’t travel everywhere I want because it isn’t safe so I was never allowed on fun field trips in school/uni.
